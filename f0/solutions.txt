1. home/pedro directory (the home directory)

2.
mkdir dir1
cd dir1
mkdir dir2 dir3
cd dir2
mkdir dir4 dir5
cd dir4
mkdir dir6
cd ~

3. dir2/

4.
cd dir1/dir2/dir4
touch g22.doc 
cd ../
touch f1.txt
touch h22.txt 
touch g368.txt 
cd ../
cd dir3/ 
touch f3a.txt 
touch g56.doc 
touch g3x.txt

5. both commands are searching for .txt files which
start with an 'fg', followed by a '35' and a sequence of characters
from 4 to 7 and a to z. 
there isn't any file in dir1/dir2 which matches this description, so nothing is
printed.
in dir1/dir3 the file "f3a.txt" obeys the criteria, so the following is printed on screen:
dir1/dir3/f3a.txt

6. the command deletes dir2 and every sub-directory for dir2.
therefore the only remaining directories are dir1 and dir3.

7.
octal  |  binary
1      |  0 0 0  
2      |  0 0 1
3      |  0 1 0
4      |  0 1 1
5      |  1 0 0
6      |  1 0 1
7      |  1 1 1

chmod 751
7 refers to the perms of 'users'
5 refers to the perms of 'groups'
1 refers to the perms of 'others'

7 in octal is 1 1 1. reading the number from right to left
we get:
read perm - 1
write perm - 1
execute perm - 1

therefore users have every permission available

8.

9.

first command:
pine:1.2
oak:0.9
birch
yew:4.3

second command:

yew:4.3

10.
the first command copies the text in q1.txt to q2.txt except
the occurrences of 'Ring' are replaced by 'Sword'.

11. diff compares both files line by line and outputs 
the differences between both files.

12.
the first command sorts the list of numbers by ascending order
the second command sorts the list of strings by ascending order

13. it displays the number of active processes
